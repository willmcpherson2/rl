simple server-client architecture

server sends state to client
client renders state
client sends inputs to server
server simulates inputs on state
repeat

server: state -> client
client: render(state)
client: input -> server
server: simulate(state, input)
...

you could also simulate locally on the client after sending the input, to get
inaccurate but quick feedback
